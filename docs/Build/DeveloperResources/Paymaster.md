# Available gas payment solutions

On the Bitlayer network, we place tremendous importance on collaborative ecosystem development. Recognizing the diverse gas payment needs of projects, such as providing gas subsidies for end-users or enabling transaction fee payments via ERC20 tokens, we are continuously working with our ecosystem partners to enhance infrastructure and develop comprehensive solutions to meet these requirements.

Currently, there are several potential solutions:

1. Bitlayer can collaborate directly with projects to implement gas fee waivers for specific target addresses (with scenario-specific limitations);

2. (Coming soon) Bitlayer provides EIP-4337 infrastructure (Bundler and paymaster platform). Developers can independently create and manage AA Smart wallets for users (or integrate existing third-party AA wallet SDKs), and then integrate the Bitlayer Paymaster platform service to offer diverse, account-abstraction-based gas payment and reduction options;

3. Dapp developers can also integrate services from existing EIP-4337 service providers like Particle, offering users account-abstraction-based gas payment and reduction alternatives;

4. Additional solutions, such as post-transaction refunds, are also under consideration.

If your project needs any help about above solutions, feel free to contact our BDs (build@bitlayer.org).
